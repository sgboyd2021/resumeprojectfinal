<h2>Work Experience</h2>

<h2>Other Interesting Facts</h2>
<ol>
<li>I have loved reading since I was little. My earliest favorite books were the <em> Rainbow Magic </em> fairy books that I read in kindergarten.</li>
<li>Both of my parents were swimmers. My dad came less than a second away from the Olympics, and my mom was a lifeguard and taught swimming lessons at her local pool. This trait has passed on to my little brother and me. We both swam for Kingfish last year, but this year I am swimming for the high school swim team.</li>
<li>I have been doing CrossFit for the past three years. I normally like to go twice a week, but this year I can only do once a week because of the point below.</li>

<li>I have been going to my camp, Waukeela, for the past six years. This upcoming summer will be my seventh year. I go to the camp in New Hampshire for four weeks every summer.</li>
